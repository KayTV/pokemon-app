<h1>Front End Project</h1>
  <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p>My project is goint to a game in which it is basically a pokemon battle. You enter in a number and get your pokemon,
    then a random pokemon is generated for you to battle against. Denpending on your stat points, you either win or lose.
    Currently the basic's of the project are created. There's a lot of details to add to fix the bugs of the game and to make
    it more like the actual Pokemon game</p>

  <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>The layout of the page is very basic, using only HTML and CSS to create the design. The main part of this project is the
    actual function of it which is all JQuery and Vanialla JS with and AJAX request for the Pokemon API. Only bootstrap being
    used is the actual pop-up in order to play the game</p>
  <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>Ability to Choose Your Pokemon</h3>
      <p>Using the AJAX request, user has the ability to pick any Pokemon that is in the database (currently, there is 718 options).
      This pick will be by either the number or the name you type in</p>
    <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>Music from the original game will be added in from the original games to get the sense you're in a battle</p>
